                <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                <p> Hi, my name is Joshua and I'm currently a second year biomedical engineering student at the
                    University of British Columbia.
                    My goal is to positively impact humanity by creating advanced yet controlled technology in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context. 
                    I'm always striving to learn more about the biotechnology field to promote continuous improvement in the field of biomedical engineering
                    <br><br>

                    Service was always an important part of my life since I was young. I strongly believe in people and that human relationships are what makes our life worth.
                    Thus, I tend to help others in the best of my ability and influence others to do the same when an opportunity arises.  
                    Particularly, I believe Biomeidcal Engineering is the field for me because I believe it is the most direct way to impact people's
                    lives. My ultimate goals and motives in life are shared in my Medium page, so be sure them out too!

                    <br><br>
                    I'm highly motivated and I enjoy utilizing my creativity and problem-solving skills to find new, possible advancements.
                    For instance, I decided to co-found Studio, a social medica platform, in pursuit of improving my computer technical skills.

                My group and I entered the APSC 100 Assistive design competition, an open competition for all APSC 100 courses, to 
                create an assistive device for a specific client named Ken Fraser. 
                Ken Fraser had paralysis down the his lower armpits and restricted movement in his wrists.
                Thus, we created a device that could enable him to not only pick up keys from the ground, but also to steer and accelerate his wheelchair forward using a rod grip with no wrist movement required. 
                We sketched out our potential designs and used Solid Works to 3D model and print out our chosen device. 
                <br><br>
                The device was successful, as we placed overall 2nd in the competition. 
                On top of that, the 1st and 2nd places recieved an honorary invite to have lunch with the Dean of Engineering at UBC!!

                <h2>My Personal Website</h2>
                <p>To practice my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills, I have created my own personal website! 
                    This was my first attempt on front-end coding, and I definitely had a lot of fun making it. 
                    I used Visual Studio Code for the framework, and used free online tutorials to teach myself how to code. 
                    The coding for this particular website is poorly designed and poorly optimized, but I was still able to grasp an understanding of my weaknesses in general front-end web development. 
              
                I plan to carry on my passion for coding, and improve my front-end coding with more practice and to also learn back-end development.

                    In today's world, delivery services are heavily reliant on established delivery companies such as FedEx and UPS. 
                    Big corporates like Amazon have delivery fees that cuts too large for small businesses to expand. 
                    Therefore, we have come up with a solution to empower local business deliveries and consumer parcel deliveries by 
                    creating a SaaS (Software as a Service) peer to peer delivery system. He believes that by enabling 
                    an eCommerce revolution into a relatively undisrupted parcel and mail delivery market could create profitable and ease to businesses and consumers. 
                    The project is still in the making, as we are still in the stage of system development, market research, member recuritment, and much more.

                    <p>
                        Entangle is a non-profit organization that aims to teach coding and design to newcomer youth and refugees in the Lower Mainland of Canada.
                        The motive for this organization stems from my friend Enrique, who immigrated to Canada from El Salvador. 
                        His family didn't speak good English, thus Enrique even at a young age was pressured to take many legal responsibilities. 
                        Through perseverance and many help from his peers, he was able to thrive and make it to UBC engineering.
                        Now, we wish to help students and immmigrants that were in the same situation as Enrique by pairing them with mentors in STEM and guiding them to the path of success.
